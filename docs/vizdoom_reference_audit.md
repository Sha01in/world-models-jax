# Supplied-model reference audit

This diagnostic port loads the authors' public Doom VAE, RNN and controller
without a TensorFlow installation. It is separate from the reproduction's
trained checkpoints and evaluation pipeline. Loading supplied weights does not
reproduce training or establish the paper's 1092-step real-game mean.

The reference files come from
[`hardmaru/WorldModelsExperiments`, revision
`fd982b9691a941b52c6addbde29bc801ca6202c8`](https://github.com/hardmaru/WorldModelsExperiments/tree/fd982b9691a941b52c6addbde29bc801ca6202c8/doomrnn).
The downloader saves source URLs, byte counts and SHA-256 fingerprints in a
manifest. It preserves existing files and rejects modified or unrecognized
files. Downloads, weights and generated audit reports remain ignored by Git.

The port explicitly handles:

- TensorFlow's LSTM gate order, forget-bias offset and restart input/state reset.
- The factorized mixture-head layout and unclamped reference log standard deviations.
- NHWC-to-CHW encoder flattening and transpose-convolution kernel orientation.
- Native-frame cropping and the original SciPy RGB bytescaling/byte-cast behavior.

The last point is easy to misread: the old resize function returns bytes before
the wrapper computes `((1.0 - obs) * 255).round().astype(np.uint8)`. The final
cast wraps modulo 256; applying the expression to normalized floats produces
different pixels. A test executes the pinned legacy preprocessing functions
on three native images and checks byte-for-byte agreement. The harness uses
equivalent replacements for removed `np.float`, `ndarray.tostring` and
`Image.isImageType` APIs. Both paths use the installed Pillow; this is not a
comparison against the historical Pillow runtime.

## Reproduce the checks

From the repository root in the configured Linux/WSL virtual environment:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/tools/fetch_doom_reference.py \
  --output-dir artifacts/doom_reference_round5/fd982b9

JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=4 \
  .venv/bin/python -m unittest tests.test_doom_reference -v

JAX_PLATFORMS=cpu OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=4 \
  .venv/bin/python scripts/tools/audit_doom_reference_port.py \
  --reference-dir artifacts/doom_reference_round5/fd982b9 \
  --output artifacts/doom_reference_round5_port_cpu_audit_checked.json
```

The preprocessing comparison skips when the optional downloaded legacy source
is absent. The model audit requires the completed, fingerprint-checked download
and refuses to replace an existing report. Use a new output filename for a
later audit.

## Measured results, 2026-10-03

All 39 CPU unit tests passed, including the three reference tests and their
legacy preprocessing comparison. The full supplied-weight CPU audit also passed
against independent NumPy convolutions, transpose-convolution scatter additions
and recurrent equations:

| Calculation | Maximum absolute difference |
| --- | ---: |
| Encoder means, three synthetic frames | 0.0000008345 |
| Encoder log variances, three synthetic frames | 0.0000019074 |
| Decoder, one synthetic latent vector | 0.0000002980 |
| Recurrent states, 128 steps including restarts | 0.0000133514 |
| Controller actions on those states | 0.0000107884 |

The local report records the downloaded-file fingerprints, port/test source
fingerprints and tolerances. These checks establish numerical agreement with
independent implementations of the reference equations, not with a running
TensorFlow 1.8 session. The historical Pillow version, scenario/engine equality
and provenance of the exact checkpoint used for the paper's reported score
remain unverified. No real-game performance evaluations or training runs were
launched for this audit; there is no new measured real-game performance result.

The next diagnostic boundary is to verify the reference environment and
observation/action/recurrent-state timing before evaluating the supplied
controller on fresh seeds. That comparison should identify protocol differences
before changing our trained models.
